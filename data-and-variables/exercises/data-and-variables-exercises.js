// Calculate a space mission!
// We need to determine how many days it will take to reach Mars.

// Create and assign a miles to Mars variable. 
// You can get the miles to Mars by multiplying the distance to Mars in kilometers by the miles per kilometer.

//  Check your solution
// Next, we need a variable to hold the hours it would take to get to Mars. 
// To get the hours, you need to divide the miles to Mars by the shuttleâ€™s speed.

//  Check your solution
// Finally, declare a variable and assign it the value of days to Mars. 
// In order to get the days it will take to reach Mars, you need to divide the hours it will take to reach Mars by 24.
